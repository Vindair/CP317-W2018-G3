      1. Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
      Improving the current state of subletting would be beneficial to students throughout our target market (KW Region), as we will be able to consolidate listings posted on non-specialized platforms, as well as provide quality assurance on the posted listings. The database of sublet listings will be organized based on standard filters for renting such as location, rating, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website will display the listing information found in the database in the form of text, diagrams, or maps. The website will allow administrators to insert, edit, and remove entries from the database/website at their discretion. A website user would be allowed access to the data on the front-end and browse through the listings on the site, as well as post new listings.
    </p>
    <h2 id="11purpose">
      1.1. Purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
      The current state of subletting is disorganized and inconvenient to use, with the most popular platform being FaceBook--a site not even designed for posting sublets. Subby will allow for listings on FaceBook, Kijiji, and other sites to be consolidated, thus providing a more comprehensive product than what is currently available to the student sublettng market.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is to provide:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Subletters:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple interface to browse through sublet listings, easily sorted using specialized filters
          </li>
          <li>Ability to contact sublessors through site or through provided contact information
          </li>
          <li>Security in browsing since all listings will go through a verification process to confirm legitimacy
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sublessors:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to post new sublet listings according to site policy
          </li>
          <li>Ability to modify existing listings in case any information changes
          </li>
          <li>Allows for listings to be seen by verified users, and be contacted by these users
          </li>
          <li>Provide an interface to let one know the current competitive pricing in the property area
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Administrators:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>All functionality available to users, as well as the ability to remove and edit any listing at their discretion
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

      2.2.1. User Package
    </h3>
    <p>
      The User package contains the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Entity Object:</strong> User
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Control Objects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>User Creator: Create and persist Users to the database
          </li>
          <li>User Manager: Edit and Destroy Users
          </li>
          <li>User Retriever: Retrieve single records of a User for display
          </li>
          <li>User Lister: List the index of Users
          </li>
        </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As displayed in the Class Diagram, visitors are the only actors who will be able to use the User Creator view and controller. Administrators and regular users will be able to display accounts, and possibly edit them depending on their role.
    </p>
    <h3 id="222subletpackage">
      2.2.2. Sublet Package
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Sublet package contains the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Entity Object:</strong> Sublet

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that controllers such as the Sublet Manager will determine, based on User role, whether an actor has permission to edit or destroy a Sublet record. The Sublet Searcher controller will have no such authorization, as it is open to both visitors and regular users.
    </p>
    <h3 id="223ratingpackage">

    <h3 id="521taskspecifications">
      5.2.1. Task Specifications
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 1: Logging into Subby management tool.</strong> The user opens a web browser and navigates to the Subby management tool login page. The user enters valid admin credentials and logs in by selecting the "Login" button.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 2: Creating a user. (Prerequisites: Task 1 as Administrator)</strong> An administrator selects the "Create User" which generates a overlayed display that prompts them to fill in the following fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Username
      </li>
      <li>Password
      </li>
      <li>E-mail Address
      </li>
      <li>Birth Date
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An administrator enters the relevant information and selects the "Create" button. If the user information already exists in the database, an error message is displayed, indicating that the entry is a duplicate. Otherwise, a notification will prompt the admin of successful user creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 3: Modifying an existing user's information. (Prerequisites: Task 1, Task 2 if no users currently exist)</strong> An administrator looks at the current database of users, and selects the "Edit User" action next to a user entry. A new page is loaded displaying the information of the selected user. The administrator is then prompted to edit any of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Username
      </li>
      <li>Password
      </li>
      <li>E-mail
      </li>
      <li>Birth Date
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally, the administrator is afforded the ability to see all listings currently posted by the selected user; the ability to complete Tasks 5 and 10 can also be done within Task 3 if any available listings exist. An administrator makes the desired information changes and presses the "Save" button at the bottom of the form. Should the administrator attempt to make invalid changes, such as duplication of information, an error message will be displayed. Otherwise, the information is committed. Alternatively, should the administrator deem no changes neccesary, there is a "Cancel" button next to the "Save" button to bring the administrator to their previous viewing page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 4: Deleting a user. (Prerequisites: Task 1, Task 2 if no users currently exist)</strong> An administrator views all the users entered in the database, and selects the "Delete User" button next to the data entry. This issues a prompt asking for confirmation as to whether or not to proceed with the deletion. Should the administrator press "Confirm", the data entry will be removed from the database. Otherwise, the administrator presses "Cancel", resulting in the prompt disappearing and no changes occurring to the database. Note that deleting a user will also remove all listings posted by said user.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 5: Deleting a sublet listing. (Prerequisites: Task 1)</strong> An administrator views the database containing all listings, and selects the "Delete Listing" button next to the data entry. This issues a prompt asking for confirmation as to whether or not to proceed with the deletion. Should the administrator press "Confirm", a prompt will appear with a form asking the administrator to file a reason for deletion. The admin then fills in a relevant reason for deletion, and presses "Okay". The data entry will be removed from the database, and a message to the lister is sent with the reason specified for deletion. Otherwise, the administrator presses "Cancel" resulting in the prompt disappearing and no changes occurring to the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 6: Logout. (Prerequisites: Task 1)</strong> An administrator presses the "Logout" button in the top right corner of the management tool, which take the user back to the login page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 7: Creating an account using Subby sign-up interface.</strong> The user navigates to the home page of Subby and presses the "Register" button in the top right corner of the website, creating an overlay over the current page prompting the user to enter the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Username
      </li>
      <li>Password
      </li>
      <li>E-mail
      </li>
      <li>Birth Date
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally, the user must pass a captcha to ensure human entry. A link to terms of service and privacy policy will be included below the form for the user to read if neccesary. Upon entering the correct information, the user presses the "Sign Up" button at the bottom of the overlay, which will then prompt the user as to whether or not the account creation was successful. A successful account creation must follow the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-duplicate username
      </li>
      <li>Password conforming to site-specified rules
      </li>
      <li>Non-duplicate e-mail address
      </li>
      <li>Valid captcha entry Upon success, the overlay will disappear and be replaced by a pop-up informing the user that a verification email has been sent to their address. Upon failure, the form will highlight where the errors are in red around the specific entries and prompt the user to enter their information again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 8: Logging into Subby using login interface. (Prerequisites: Task 7)</strong> The user logs by selecting the "Login" button in the top right corner of the web page. This creates an overlay over the current page prompting the user to enter their login information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Username/E-mail
      </li>
      <li>Password
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Upon entering their credentials, the user selects the "Sign in" button at the bottom of the overlay, which then indicates to the user whether or not their credentials are valid or not. If the former, the user is redirected to the home page, otherwise the overlay displays an error message indicating that invalid credentials are entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Task 9: Inserting a new sublet listing. (Prerequisites: Task 8)</strong> The user selects the "Post Listing" button in the top right corner of the page. This loads a new page containing a form for the user to fill out about their listing. Such listing fields include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Location
      </li>
